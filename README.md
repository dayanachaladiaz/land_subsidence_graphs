## Overview

The experimental setup is shown in Figure 1. It consists of a rectangular tank with
2.70 m (length) × 1.25 m (height) × 0.10 m (width) divided into three compartments
(3, 7, 10) a central compartment containing the porous media (2.50 m long) and two lateral
compartments (0.10 m long) for observing the water level. A fine screen mesh (4, 9) with
holes of 0.074 mm (also known as mesh No. 200) separates the lateral compartments from
the central compartment, preventing sand from flowing from the central into the side ones.
The sand was silica sand, specifically quarzitic sand with 94.7% silica content. Fine and
coarse sand with effective diameters of 0.39 mm and 0.67 mm, respectively, were used.
There are also two side chambers (2, 11) that control the water level. These chambers
are connected to the tank through pipes and transparent flexible tubes. The tank is made of
transparent Plexiglas with a thickness of 15 mm and is supported by a reinforced steel frame.
Steel tension pins were also added to strengthen the tank and prevent side deformation.
Three vertical displacement transducers were located at the top of the central compartment
separated 1.25 m from each other (8). The displacement transducers (LVDT) were the
Model Humbolt type HM-2310.04 range 0.4′′ (10 mm) with a precision of 0.001 mm. Two
side reservoirs (1, 14) with their respective pumps (5, 13) were included to store freshwater
and supply the lateral chambers, the left tank with a volume of 250 L and the right tank
with a volume of 500 L.

The first step was to pack the sand simultaneously with the water on the lateral
compartments. To guarantee the uniformity of the grain size and avoid the formation of air
spaces and undesired strata, a packing technique was applied. It consisted of filling 10 cm
of water prior to adding 10 cm of sand, this process was repeated until the amount of soil
reached 1.10 cm. This process was applied for both coarse and fine sand.
The subsidence process was measured every 24-h using both analog and digital
longitudinal vertical displacement transducers (LVDT) type HM-2310.04 Modelo Humbolt
range 0.4′′ (10 mm) and a precision of 0.001 mm. The exploitation was simulated by
lowering the water level from 1.1 to 0.8 m in chambers (2) and (11), and the recharge was
simulated by increasing the water level from 0.8 to 1.1 m. To initiate the exploitation cycles
(lowering and increasing the water level), the hydraulic head was set to its initial height
of 1.1 m. The surface level of the sand was registered at the beginning of the experiment,
and it was considered the reference level to measure the vertical displacement of the sand.
Hereafter, the hydraulic head was lowered to 0.8 m and this level was maintained for 24 h.
The subsequent exploitation cycle began 24 h after the previous one, lowering the water
table by 30 cm. A total of four scenarios of exploitations, recharge, and stabilization cycles
were conducted, including two for fine sand and two scenarios for coarse sand. The selected
drawdown was considered based on the evidenced depletion of unconfined aquifers
subjected to overexploitation. Among the considered drawdowns are a 50% drawdown
of the Lower Bengal Delta (Yu et. al. 2019), a 43% drawdown of the Aguascalientes Valley, 42% at the
Wuxi city aquifer, and an average drawdown of 27.66% of the total depth of the Arroyo
Grande Aquifer, an unconfined sandy aquifer in Cartagena, Colombia. Therefore, for this
study, the considered drawdown was 30 cm, also equivalent to a 27% drawdown of the
experimental setup.

## Features

> After the experiments were developed, a numerical model was designed to explore
the capabilities of CFD platforms to recreate subsidence experimental results in sands. 

> Both the experimental data and simulated data were analyzed using error measurements and statistical analysis. 

After you collect the experimental data and have the results from the CFD simulations, you can use my project to analyze and compare the results of the three sensors and the numerical simulations. It will help you identify if there is a close agreement between experiments and numerical model.

This project offers:
- **User-Friendly Interface**:  
  Intuitive design allows users to interact with the application easily.

- **Fast and Accurate**:  
  Processes data quickly with minimal resource consumption, ensuring precise results.

- **Customizable Configurations**:  
  Users can modify parameters (e.g., input file formats, simulation settings) to suit their specific use case.

- **Supports Multiple Data Formats**:  
  Accepts input in CSV, and XML formats.

- **Visualizations**:  
  Automatically generates graphs and charts to help users interpret the results.
